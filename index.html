                I live in a peaceful world, where the sun shines brightly and the sky is a beautiful blue with a shimmer of rain pitter patters the soft ground as it falls. I have a loving family and my true best friend in the whole world is my dog named ICHIRO who care about me and I care about him. I am grateful for all the good things in my life especially for ICHIRO being in my life.

                As I look past my head I look down towards ICHIRO wondering what's behind me. I ponder the same question over and over again. ICHIRO looks at me with his big brown eyes and I can see the love he has for me.

                ICHIRO looking for a snack begging me to give him a treat. "ICHIRO what do you want?" I ask him intentfully. As he looks at me a strange hooded figrue off in the distance starts waking towards me and ICHIRO with malicious intent. ICHIRO starts barking at the hooded figure and I start to feel a sense of dread wash over me. ICHIRO is barking louder and louder as the hooded figure gets closer and closer.

            "Hey who are you? Why are you here?" I ask the hooded figure. The hooded figure just stands there and doesn't say a word. ICHIRO starts to bark even louder and I can see the fear in his eyes. The hooded figure starts to walk towards us and ICHIRO starts to growl even louder. I start to feel scared and ICHIRO starts to bark even louder. The hooded figure stops and looks at us with a sinister smile on his face.

            "I have come for the most precios thing in your life." The hooded figure says in a deep voice. ICHIRO starts to bark even louder and I can see the fear in his eyes. The hooded figure just stands there and smirks but he doesn't say a word. The hooded figure starts to walk towards us and ICHIRO starts to growl even louder.

            "If you want ICHIRO, you'll have to go through me first!" I yell at the hooded figure."Fine so be it then." The hooded figure smirks then dashes at immense speeds and took some slashes at me. "I will protect ICHIRO!" I yell back at the hooded figure.

            "You were a fool to think you could protect him." The hooded figure says as he slashes at me again. I dodge the attack and ICHIRO jumps in front of me and starts barking at the hooded figure. "Get back ICHIRO!" I yell at him but he doesn't listen. The hooded figure slashes at ICHIRO and I jump in front of him to protect him.

            "ICHIIIIIROOOOOOOO!" I yell as ICHIRO gets slashed by the hooded figure. ICHIRO yelps in pain and falls to the ground. I can see the blood pouring out of his body and I start to feel a sense of rage wash over me. "You bastard!" I yell at the hooded figure. "You will pay for what you have done!" I charge at the hooded figure with all my might and I can feel the power surging through my body. but suddenly I jolt in pain and as I realize ICHIRO is dead. I fall to my knees and start to cry. "Why did you have to die ICHIRO?" I yell at the hooded figure. "You took everything from me!" The hooded figure just stands there and smirks at me."Ive done my deeds and now you shall suffer." The hooded figure says as he walks away.

            ICHIRO laying there dead on the ground, blood pouring from his body. I can see the life leaving his eyes and I start to feel a sense of emptiness wash over me. "I will never forget you ICHIRO." I say as I look at his lifeless body. "You were my best friend and I will always love you." I start to cry even harder and I can feel the pain in my heart. "I will never forgive that hooded figure for what he has done." I say as I look at the hooded figure walking away.
